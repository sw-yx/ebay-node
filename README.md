### Calling the eBay Finding REST API (specifically findCompletedItems endpoint) with Node.js and async/await

Not to sell myself short, but a lot of this is aggregated functions, mainly async functions, so it may be confusing at first glance. I plan to update this and would be very grateful for suggestions and ideas. The main driving force behind this project was a desire to further my understanding of asynchrnous Javascript (e.g. Promises).

I'll clean this up later, but for now the only prerequisites are:

'request-promise' package --> `npm request-promise`

and your own eBay developer ID, which you can sign up for at: [https://developer.ebay.com]
